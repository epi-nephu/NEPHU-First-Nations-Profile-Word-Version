- Data for this indicator were obtained from the 2022-23 ABS National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey.

- Overall, 26% of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander adult survey respondents (aged 18 years and over) living in Victoria met the daily fruit consumption guidelines which recommend a minimum number of daily serves based on a person's age and sex. This equates to approximately 12,700 Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander adults in Victoria.

- Overall, 58% of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander child survey respondents (aged 2 to 17 years) living in Victoria met the daily fruit consumption guidelines. This equates to approximately 16,000 Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children in Victoria.

- Female survey respondents were more likely to have met the daily fruit consumption guidelines than males for both adults (29% vs. 23%) and children (63% vs. 56%).

- 18% of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander survey respondents living in Greater Melbourne reported that they consumed more fruit at the time of the survey than they did at the same time in the previous year, and 65% reported that their level of fruit consumption was similar to the same time in the previous year.

- Male survey respondents were more likely to have increased their fruit consumption compared to the same time in the previous year than females (22% vs. 14%).

- Vegetable consumption was assessed using the National Health and Medical Research Councilâ€™s [2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/adg).

    - The Guidelines recommend a minimum number of daily serves based on a person's age and sex.
    
    - A serve of vegetables is approximately half a cup of cooked vegetables (including legumes) or one cup of salad vegetables (equivalent to approximately 75 grams).
    
    - Tomatoes were included as vegetables.
    
    - All drinks, beverages and juices were excluded.

- Overall, 59% of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander adult survey respondents (aged 18 years and over) living in Victoria consumed sugar sweetened drinks at least once per week. This equates to approximately 29,100 Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander adults in Victoria. Males were more likely to consume sugar sweetened drinks at least once per week than females (70% vs. 52%).

- Overall, 54% of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander child survey respondents (aged 2 to 17 years) living in Victoria consumed sugar sweetened drinks at least once per week. This equates to approximately 14,800 Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children in Victoria. Females were more likely to consume sugar sweetened drinks at least once per week than males (62% vs. 47%).

- 22% of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander survey respondents living in Greater Melbourne reported that they consumed sugar sweetened drinks daily.
